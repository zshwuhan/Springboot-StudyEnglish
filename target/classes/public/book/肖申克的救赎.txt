德弗瑞恩先生
Mr. Dufresne, describe...



…描述一下你太太被谋杀当晚，你曾和她谈过些什么？
...the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.



一些很糟糕的话
It was very bitter.



她说她很高兴我已知道，她不想再偷偷摸摸了
She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around.



她说她想离婚
And she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.



-你当时有什么反应？ -我对她说我不会在乎的
- What was your response? - I told her I would not grant one.



“在我看见你在雷诺市前，下地狱吧！”
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."



你的邻居曾听你说过这些话吧？
Those were your words, according to your neighbors.



随他们怎么说
If they say so.



我当时很不开心，什么都不记得了
I really don't remember. I was upset.



你和太太争吵后发生了什么事？
What happened after you argued with your wife?



她收拾好行李
She packed a bag.



到昆汀先生家里去了
She packed a bag to go and stay with Mr. Quentin.



格伦·昆汀，职业高尔夫教练
Glenn Quentin, golf pro at the Snowden Hills Country Club...



你知道他是你妻子的情人
... whom you had discovered was your wife's lover.



你跟踪她了吗？
Did you follow her?



我先去了几间酒吧找
I went to a few bars first.



接着，我开车去了昆汀家，但他们不在家里
Later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home.



我把车停在街角
I parked in the turnout...



等在那里
... and waited.



有何企图吗？
With what intention?



我不太确定
I'm not sure.



我非常困惑
I was confused...



还有点醉
... drunk.



我觉得
I think...



我只是想吓一吓他们
... mostly I wanted to scare them.



他们到家后，你就进屋杀了他们
When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.



没有，我控制了自己
I was sobering up.



我开车回家睡觉来忘记一切
I got back in the car and I drove home to sleep it off.



在回家的路上，我把枪扔进了河里
Along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River.



我很肯定这一点
I've been very clear on this point.



但我感到奇怪的是，第二天早上清洁女工发现……
I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning...



你太太和她的情人死在床上
...and finds your wife in bed with her lover...



致死的子弹是出自点38口径的手枪
...riddled with.38-caliber bullets.



德福瑞恩先生，你和我一样都觉得那是巧合吗？
Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?



确实是巧合
Yes, it does.



你仍坚持说你在凶案发生前
Yet you still maintain you threw your gun into the river...



已经把枪扔进河里了吗？
...before the murders took place.



这对你很有利
That's very convenient.



这是事实
It's the truth.



警察在河里找了三天，但他们没有找到你的枪……
The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found...



所以无法鉴定
...so no comparison could be made between your gun and the bullets...



死者身上的子弹是否出自你的枪
...taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.



这对你来说
And that also...



也非常有利，不是吗，德福瑞恩先生？
...is very convenient. Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?



因为我是无辜的……
Since I am innocent of this crime...



所以我发现找不到枪对我非常不利
...I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.



各位先生女士，你们听到了所有的证据
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.



我们有他犯罪的动机，我们找到他的脚印
We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have footprints.



留有他的指纹的子弹头
Bullets on the ground bearing his fingerprints.



打碎的酒瓶上也留有他的指纹
A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints.



最重要的是
And most of all...



我们知道他的妻子和她的情人
... we have a beautiful young woman and her lover...



双双倒卧在血泊中
... lying dead in each other's arms.



他们是犯了错
They had sinned.



但他们所犯的错严重到……
But was their crime so great...



……需要用死来赎罪吗？
... as to merit a death sentence?



当你们考虑时
While you think about that...



请想想这个……
...think about this:



一个弹匣只能装六颗子弹，而不是八颗
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.



我肯定这不只是一时冲动而犯下的罪行
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion.



那至少是可以理解的，即使不能宽恕
That at least could be understood, if not condoned.



不！
No.



这是复仇
This was revenge...



一个冷血者的复仇，看看这些：
...of a much more brutal, cold-blooded nature. Consider this:



每个死者都身中四枪
Four bullets per victim.



总共是八枪而不是六枪
Not six shots fired, but eight.



那表明子弹打完后
That means that he fired the gun empty...



他还停下来装子弹
... and then stopped to reload...



以便再次向他们开枪
... so that he could shoot each of them again.



每人多加一枪
An extra bullet per lover...



就在头部
... right in the head.



德弗瑞恩先生，我觉得你非常冷血
You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.



看着你都令我毛骨耸然
It chills my blood just to look at you.



我以本州赋予我的权利
By the power vested in me by the state of Maine...



判处你两项终身监禁
...I hereby order you to serve two life sentences back-to-back...



分别为两位死者，退庭！
...one for each of your victims. So be it!



坐下来
Sit.



你因被判终身监禁己在此二十年？
We see you've served 20 years of a life sentence?



-是的，先生 -你感到后悔吗？
- Yes, sir. - You feel you've been rehabilitated?



是的，绝对有，先生
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.



我是说，我得到了教训
I mean, I learned my lesson.



我敢说我已经完全改变了
I can honestly say that I'm a changed man.



我不会再危害社会
I'm no longer a danger to society.



这是神的真理
That's God's honest truth.



“不合格”



嗨，瑞德
Hey, Red.



怎么样了？
How'd it go?



不同的日子，同样的结果
Same old shit, different day.



我知道你的感受的
Yeah, I know how you feel.



我下星期又要被否决了
I'm up for rejection next week.



对，我上星期也被否决了
Yeah, I got rejected last week.



一向如此
It happens.



嗨，瑞德，给我一包烟
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.



滚开！你已欠我五包烟了
Get out of my face, man! You're into me for five packs already.



-是四包！ -五包！
Four!



我想在美国的每个联邦或州监狱里都有像我一样的人物
There must be a con like me in every prison in America.



就是能够给你搞到东西的家伙
I'm the guy who can get it for you.



定制的香烟，一包大麻……
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer, if that's your thing...



为庆祝你儿子或女儿高中毕业的一瓶白兰地， 只要你喜欢
... bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation.



或者几乎所有东西……
Damn near anything within reason.



是的，先生，我是个冷酷的人
Yes, sir! I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.



所以1949年当安迪·德福瑞恩来找我
So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949...



问能否弄张丽塔·海华丝的图片进来时 （丽塔·海华丝：Rita，Hayworth）
... and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...



我告诉他没问题
... I told him, "No problem."



安迪·杜福雷在1947年来到肖申克监狱
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...



罪名是谋杀他的妻子和她的情人
... in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was banging.



入狱以前，他是波特兰银行的副总裁
On the outside, he'd been vice president of a large Portland bank.



对他来说是年青有为
Good work for a man so young.



好啊，瑞德



你会说英语吗？
You speak English, butt-steak?



跟着这个长官走
You follow this officer.



我一生中从没见过这么差劲的人
I never seen such a sorry-Iooking heap of maggot shit in all my life.



过来啊！到这里来
Hey, fish! Come over here!



今天要赌吗，瑞德？
Taking bets today, Red?



赌烟还是赌钱？
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.



香烟，我赌两根
Smokes. Put me down for two.



好吧，你买哪一个？
All right, who's your horse?



那个又矮又瘦的
That little sack of shit.



-排在第八的，他会是第一个的 -妈的！我也想买他
- Eighth. He'll be first. - Bullshit! I'll take that action.



你输定了，孩子
You're out some smokes, son.



该你下注了
If you're so smart, you call it.



我买那边的那个胖子
I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.



排在第五的那个，我赌四根香烟
The fifth one. Put me down for a quarter deck.



今天又有新人
Fresh fish today!



我们又有的玩了
We're reeling them in!



我承认我初次见到安迪的时候，没什么特别的感觉
I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him.



他看起来似乎风一吹就会倒
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.



这就是我对他的第一印象
That was my first impression of the man.



你买谁？
What do you say?



那个高个子
That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass.



那个人？不可能的
That guy? Never happen.



-我赌十根香烟 -那可是大赌注
- 10 cigarettes. - That's a rich bet.



谁来证明我看错了？
Who's going to prove me wrong?



海伍德？济格？
Heywood? Jigger?



史基？
Skeets?



弗洛德？
Floyd!



四个胆小鬼
Four brave souls.



回囚房去，要查房了
Return to your cellblocks for evening count.



所有犯人都回囚房去
All prisoners, return to your cellblocks.



向右转
Turn to the right!



往前看
Eyes front.



这是哈德利先生，他是这里的看守长
This is Mr. Hadley. He's captain of the guards.



我是诺顿，这里的典狱长
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.



你们都被判有罪了
You are convicted felons.



因此被送到这里来
That's why they've sent you to me.



规则一
Rule number one:



不得亵渎上帝
No blasphemy.



在我的监狱里不得有人亵渎上帝
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison.



其他的条例……
The other rules...



其他的条例，你们慢慢就会知道了，还有问题吗？
...you'll figure out as you go along. Any questions?



何时吃饭？
When do we eat?



我们叫你吃的时候你就吃
You eat when we say you eat.



叫你去厕所你就去厕所
You shit when we say you shit, and piss when we say you piss.



明白吗？笨蛋？
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?



站好
On your feet.



我只相信两样东西
I believe in two things:



纪律和圣经
Discipline and the Bible.



在这里，你们两样都有
Here, you'll receive both.



把你们的思想交给上帝
Put your trust in the Lord.



你们的身体交给我
Your ass belongs to me.



欢迎来到肖申克监狱
Welcome to Shawshank.

左边
Left.



毫无疑问，第一晚是最难熬的
The first night's the toughest. No doubt about it.



赤裸裸的进囚笼，就像刚出生时那样
They march you in naked as the day you were born...



消毒药粉令皮肤像被火烧一样
... skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit.



他们把你丢进囚笼
And when they put you in that cell...



关上铁门
... and those bars slam home...



那时你才感到这是真实的
... that's when you know it's for real.



瞬间过去的一切都离你而去
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.



剩下的只有对过去的回忆
Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.



很多新来的人在第一晚都几乎发疯了
Most new fish come close to madness the first night.



有些人甚至还痛哭流涕
Somebody always breaks down crying.



一向都如此的
Happens every time.



唯一的问题是
The only question is...



谁会是第一个呢？
... who's it going to be?



我想那是用来赌博的最佳玩意
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.



我把赌注押在杜福雷身上
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.



熄灯
Lights out!



我还记得我在这里的第一晚
I remember my first night.



似乎是很久以前的事了
Seems like a long time ago.



嗨，新来的
Hey, fish.



新来的
Fish, fish.



你怕黑吗？
What are you, scared of the dark?



我打赌，你希望你爸和你妈从没把你生下来
Bet you wish your daddy never dicked your mama!



蠢猪！
Piggy! Pork! I want me a pork chop.



他们总是喜欢逗新人
The boys always go fishing with first-timers.



不达目的，誓不罢休
And they don't quit till they reel someone in.



嗨，胖子
Hey, Fat Ass.



胖子！
Fat Ass!



聊天吧
Talk to me, boy.



我知道你在那里，我能听见你的呼吸声
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.



别理别人怎么说，你听到吗？
Don't you listen to these nitwits, you hear me?



这地方没那么差劲
This place ain't so bad.



这样吧
Tell you what...



我介绍你认识他们，就像一家人
...I'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home.



我知道有几个人
I know a couple of big old bull queers that'd just...



会很乐意认识你的
...Iove to make your acquaintance.



尤其是你那又白又嫩的屁股
Especially that big, white, mushy butt of yours.



天啊！
God!



我不属于这里

求求你！我不该在这里的
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.



不该是我
Not me!



我不会警告你的
I won't count to three. Not even to one.



马上你闭上你的臭嘴，否则有你受的！
You shut up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!



-闭嘴，闭嘴 -求求你……
Shut up, man. Shut up!



你不明白的，我不该在这里的
You don't understand. I'm not supposed to be here.



把囚笼打开
Open that cell.



我也是！这里被他们弄得就像监狱
Me neither! They run this place like a fucking prison!



狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!



长官，算了
Captain, take it easy!



如果我今晚听到有半点声音
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here tonight...



我对天发誓，你们会吃不了兜着走
...I swear by God and Jesus, you will all visit the infirmary.



所有的人都不会放过的
Every last motherfucker in here.



把他抬到医疗室去
Call the trustees. Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.



德福瑞恩第一晚就让我输了两包烟

你介意吗？
Do you mind?



你真不错
That's nice and ripe.



杰克说谢谢你

它从巢里掉下来了
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.



我要照顾它直到它会飞为止
I'm going to look after him until he's big enough to fly.



不！他过来了
Oh, no! Here he comes.



早上好，各位
Morning, fellas.



不错的早晨，不是吗？
Fine morning, isn't it?



你们知道我的意思的，对吗？
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?



把它们拿出来，把它们排成排……
Send them down. I want them lined up...



非常诱人的一行
...just like a pretty little chorus line.



看看这个
Look at that.



我真受不了了
- I can't stand this guy. - Oh, Lord!



瑞查德、维吉尼亚……
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.



闻我的屁吧
Smell my ass!



再闻闻我的
After he smells mine.



很遗憾，你下注的那个输了
That's a shame about your horse coming in last and all.

他叫什么？
What was his name?



你说什么？
What'd you say?



我只是想问有人知道他的名字吗？
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.



关你屁事，新来的？
What the fuck do you care, new fish?



他叫什么都无所谓了，他已经死了
Doesn't fucking matter what his name was. He's dead.



嗨，有人和你一起吗？
Anybody come at you yet?



有人喜欢你吗？
Anybody get to you yet?



嗨，在这里我们都需要朋友
Hey, we all need friends in here.



我可以做你的朋友
I could be a friend to you.



难得手
Hard to get.



我喜欢
I like that.



安迪一开始很自闭
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.



我猜他在想办法
I guess he had a lot on his mind...



接受牢里的生活
... trying to adapt to life on the inside.



一个月以后他才开口
Wasn't until a month went by before he opened his mouth...



和某人谈话
... to say more than two words to somebody.



就像你们所看见的
As it turned out...



那个人就是我
... that somebody was me.



我是安迪·德福瑞恩
I'm Andy Dufresne.



杀妻的银行家
Wife-killing banker.



你为何要杀你的妻子？

我没有杀她
I didn't, since you ask.



你很适应合这里
You're going to fit right in.



这儿每个人都是无辜的，你不知道吗？
Everybody in here's innocent. Didn't you know that?



-你为进监狱？ -我什么都没做，律师害了我
- What you in here for? - Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.



听说你很冷酷
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.



你以为自己很了不起，对吗？
You think your shit smells sweeter than most. Is that right?



你怎么认为呢？
What do you think?



说实话，我还不知道
To tell you the truth, I haven't made up my mind.



我知道你能拿到违禁品
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.



我能搞到
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time.



你能给我个鹤嘴槌吗？
I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.



鹤嘴槌
A rock hammer.



-要干什么？ -你关心这个干吗？
- What is it and why? - What do you care?



如果是牙刷我就不会问你，我会开个价钱
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask. I'd quote a price.



但是牙刷没有杀伤力，对吗？
But a toothbrush is a non-lethal object, isn't it?



有道理
Fair enough.



一个鹤嘴槌有六至七英寸长
A rock hammer is about six or seven inches long.



-看起来像个小锄子 -锄子？
- Looks like a miniature pickax. - Pickax?



打石用的
For rocks.



-石英 -石英？
Quartz?



还有云母、页岩……
And some mica, shale...



石灰岩……
...limestone.



这么说吧
So?



我收集石头
So I'm a rock hound.



我想在这里最大限度的重操旧业
At least I was in my old life. I'd like to be again.



或许你想用它们攻击某人
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy into somebody's skull.



不，我在这里没有敌人
No, I have no enemies here.



不会？等着瞧吧
No? Wait a while.



话说回来
Word gets around.



那对姐妹花很喜欢你
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.



特别是伯格斯
Especially Bogs.



就算跟他们说我不好此道也没用
Don't suppose it would help if I told them I'm not homosexual.



他们也不是
Neither are they.



是这个地方让他们这样
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.



畜牲只知道用暴力，不管他人喜不喜欢
Bull queers take by force. That's all they want or understand.



如果我是你，我会加倍小心
If I were you, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.



-谢谢你的忠告 -忠告免费
- Thanks for the advice. - Well, that's free.



你知道我担心什么
You understand my concern.



就算我有麻烦也不会用鹤嘴槌的
If there's trouble, I won't use the rock hammer.



那我猜你想挖个洞逃出去
Then I'd guess you want to escape. Tunnel under the wall, maybe.



我说漏了什么？什么东西这么好笑
What did I miss? What's so funny?



等你看见鹤嘴槌你就明白了
You'll understand when you see the rock hammer.



买这个东西一般要多少钱？
What's an item like this usually go for?



七美元，五金铺的零售价
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.



我一般要加20%
My normal markup's 20 percent.



但这东西很特殊
But this is a specialty item.



风险越大，价钱越高，一口价，10元吧
Risk goes up, price goes up. Let's make it an even 10 bucks.



就10元吧
Ten it is.



你那是浪费钱
Waste of money, if you ask me.



为什么？
Why's that?



这里的人喜欢突击检查
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.



他们找到鹤嘴槌就会被充公
They find it, you're going to lose it.



被他们发现的话，你别把我供出来
If they catch you, you don't know me.



否则的话就别想再和我做生意了，你明白了吗？
Mention my name, we never do business again.



Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum. Now you got that?



我知道了
I understand.



谢谢你，你叫……
Thank you, Mr...



瑞德
Red.



都叫我瑞德
Name's Red.



这名字怎么来的？
Why do they call you that?



可能因为我是半个爱尔兰人吧
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.



我现在明白他们为何看中他了
I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.



他不太说话
He had a quiet way about him...



一举一动都不像普通的人
... a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.



他漫步着
He strolled...



就像在公园里散步
... like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world.



像穿了件隐形的外套
Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.



可以说
I think it'd be fair to say...



开始我对安迪就有好感
... I liked Andy from the start.



快点！我赶时间的
Let's go! Some of us got a schedule to keep.



快点
Move it! Come on, move it!



你太太对你好吗？
How you doing? How's the wife treating you?



安迪说得很对
Andy was right.



我最终拿到那玩意
I finally got the joke.



用这东西来挖隧道
It would take a man about 600 years...



起码要花六百年
... to tunnel under the wall with one of these.



-要书吗？ -今天不用了
- Book? - Not today.



要书吗？
Book?



送到德福瑞恩那里去
Delivery for Dufresne.



德福瑞恩，这是你要的书
Here's your book.



谢谢
Thanks.



漂白粉不够用了，你再去后面拿点来
We're running low on hexite. Get on back and fetch us up some.



这可以弄瞎你的眼睛
This will blind you.



亲爱的
Honey, hush.



你不懂
That's it. You fight!



你越挣扎越过瘾
Better that way.



我很想说安迪打赢了
I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight...



或者姐妹花放过了他
... and the Sisters let him be.



我希望能这么说
I wish I could tell you that...



但是监狱不是童话世界
... but prison is no fairy-tale world.



他从没提起是谁
He never said who did it.



但我们都很清楚
But we all knew.



事情就这样持续了一段时间
Things went on like that for a while.



监狱里的生活都是常规
Prison life consists of routine...



和更多的常规
... and then more routine.



安迪的脸上经常出现新的伤痕
Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.



姐妹花不断地骚扰他
The Sisters kept at him.



有时候他能逃脱
Sometimes he was able to fight them off.



但有时不能
Sometimes not.



对安迪来说
And that's how it went for Andy.



这已经成了他的常规
That was his routine.



我相信最初的两年是最糟糕的
I do believe those first two years were the worst for him.



我也相信事情再继续这样下去
And I also believe that if things had gone on that way...



这个地方会夺去他的精神
... this place would have got the best of him.



但是，在1949年的春天
But then, in the spring of 1949...



上头决定……
... the powers that be decided:



工厂的屋顶需要重修
The roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing.



我需要12名自愿者工作一星期
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.



你们知道的

And then Andy says, " Mr. Dekins...



你想让你的儿子去哈佛还是耶鲁？

傻笑着和安迪握手

安迪若穿上那套衣服

Right. The holster too.



那可以减免税款，你可把它记下来
That's tax-deductible. You can write that off.



是的！安迪就像一个正常的会计师
Yes, sir! Andy was a regular cottage industry.



事实上，在税季中他如此的忙，允许有一个帮手
In fact, it got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.



瑞德，你可以取1040号表格来吗？
Could you hand me a stack of 1040s?



每年有一个月离开监狱去木工场做工

同时，安迪仍旧不断的写信
And still, he kept sending those letters.



安迪、瑞德，布鲁斯出事了

冷静点，布鲁斯
Please, Brooks.



千万别冲动，放下来！
- Calm the fuck down. - Stay back!

- Stay back, goddamn it! - What's going on?



他突然掏出刀来
One second he's fine, then out come the knives.



有事慢慢商量好吗？
We can talk about this, right?



没商量余地的，我要割断他的喉咙
There's nothing to talk about. I'll cut his fucking throat.



他有什么对不起你？
What's he done to you?



去问狱警吧
It's what they done!



我别无选择
I got no choice.



我们都知道，你不会伤害海伍德的
You won't hurt Heywood. We all know that.



-对吗，海伍德？ -是的
- Right, Heywood? - Sure.



他是你的朋友，布鲁斯是讲道理的
He's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man.



对吗？
Right, guys?



那么把刀放下，看着我
So put the knife down. Look at me.



把刀放下
Put the knife down.



看看他的脖子
Look at his neck, for God's sake.



看看他的脖子，他在流血
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.



这是唯一
It's the only way...



使我留在这里的办法
...they'd let me stay.



你疯了，你不会这样做的
This is crazy. You don't want to do this.



放下，放下刀
Put it, put it down.



放松
Take it easy.



一切都会好的
You'll be all right.



他？那么我呢？
Him? What about me?



这个愚蠢的疯子差点割断我的喉咙
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!



你就连刮胡子也比这刮得厉害
You've had worse from shaving.



究竟怎么会这样？
What did you do to set him off?



没什么，我只是进来和他道别
Nothing. I come in here to say farewell.



难到你没听说？他获得假释
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.



我就是不明白，发生什么了
I just don't understand what happened in there.



老家伙疯了
Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.



够了
That's enough out of you.



-我听说你吓得尿流 -去你妈的
- Heard he had you shitting your pants. - Fuck you.



不要说了！
IKnock it off.



布鲁斯不是疯了
Brooks ain't no bug.



他只是被体制化了
He's just institutionalized.



体制化？什么东西？
"Institutionalized," my ass.



他在此已有五十年了，海伍德，五十年！
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood, 50 years!



这是他唯一认识的地方
This is all he knows.



在这儿，他是个重要的人
In here, he's an important man...



一个有教养的人
...an educated man.



在外面，他什么都不是
Outside, he's nothing.



只是一个假释出来的囚犯
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.



申请张借书证都有困难
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.



你明白我说的话吗？
You know what I'm trying to say?



瑞德，我相信你说是屁话
I do believe you're talking out of your ass.



怎么想随你吧
You believe whatever you want.



我告诉你，这些围墙很有趣的
But I tell you these walls are funny.



开始，你恨它们
First you hate them.



接着，你适应了它们
Then you get used to them.



时间久了
Enough time passes...



你开始离不开它们
...you get so you depend on them.



那就是被体制化了
That's "institutionalized."




Shit.



-我永远不会那样的 -对吗？
- I could never get like that. - Oh, yeah?



因为你没布鲁斯那样长时间在此
Wait till you've been here as long as Brooks.



太对了
Goddamn right.



他们把你送到这里来生活
They send you here for life...



这就是他们确实想要做的
...that's exactly what they take.



无论怎样已经部分达到了

你自由了
You're free.

大家好
Dear fellas:



外面的改变令我难以想像
I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.



老头，找死啊？
Watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?



我童年时只见过一次汽车

但现在到处都是
... but now they're everywhere.



世界在一片巨大的忙碌之中
The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.



假释委员会给我安排了中途宿舍

叫做“酿酒人”

和一份工作
... and a job...



在一家杂货店里包装食物
... bagging groceries at the Food-Way.



虽然很辛苦，但我很努力工作
It's hard work and I try to keep up...



我的手经常感到酸痛
... but my hands hurt most of the time.



记得用两层袋
Make sure your man double-bags.



上次几乎穿底了
Last time, the bottom near came out.



听到那女士说的吗？
Make sure you double-bag like the lady says. Understand?



是的，先生
Yes, sir. Surely will.



我想那店主不太喜欢我

要想一会儿才知道自己在哪儿
Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.



也许我该用枪打劫，让他们好送我回家
Maybe I should get a gun and rob the Food-Way so they'd send me home.



我可以打死那个店主，当作额外补助
I could shoot the manager while I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.



但我已经太老了，再也干不了这种蠢事
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.



我不喜欢这地方
I don't like it here.



它令我感到害怕，我决定……
I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided...



离开
... not to stay.



我怀疑他们会争论
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...



但不是为我这个老坏蛋
... not for an old crook like me.

... from Shawshank Prison.



他们只能找到泥塘中的囚衣……
All they found was a muddy set of prison clothes...



一块肥皂……
... a bar of soap...



和一个很旧的手槌
... and an old rock hammer...



几乎快被削成一小块

我曾认为用手槌要六百年才能掘通的隧道

我能想像这归功于他一丝不苟的本性

安迪朝向自由爬了五百码
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards...



我难以想像有多臭的下水道
... of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

Would you add this to your outgoing mail?



我很乐意
I'd be happy to.



-再见 -走好，先生
Good day, sir.



史蒂文先生那天早上去了将近十二家银行
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning.



加起来
All told, he blew town...



他总共提取了三十七万诺顿狱长的钱
... with better than $370,000 of Warden Norton's money.



作为十九年的赔偿
Severance pay for 19 years.



早上好，波特兰时报
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

我不知是哪把钥匙
I'm not sure which key.



别紧张，诺顿
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!



我想知道当子弹穿过他的头的时候
I like to think the last thing that went through his head...



他在想些什么
... other than that bullet...



是在想该死的安迪.德弗瑞恩到底是如何击败他？
... was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.



诺顿狱长一伙倒台之后
Not long after the warden deprived us of his company...



我收到了张明信片
... I got a postcard in the mail.



它是空白的，但是邮戳是……
It was blank, but the postmark said...



汉格堡，德萨斯州的
... Fort Hancock, Texas.



汉格堡
Fort Hancock...



就在边境那里
... right on the border.



安迪就是从那里出国的
That's where Andy crossed.



当我想到他开车向南走的时候
When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down...



我总会笑起来
... it always makes me laugh.



安迪·德弗瑞恩
Andy Dufresne...



爬过了那臭屎沟

然后干干净净的到另一边去了

安迪·德弗瑞恩

... headed for the Pacific.



哈德利抓住他的头，对吗？

Those of us who knew him best talk about him often.



我发誓，他总是带来话题

“我的朋友可以要两瓶啤酒”
"My friends could use a couple of beers."



他成功了

有时那令我伤心，虽然……
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...



安迪已经离开了
... Andy being gone.



我不得不提醒自己有些鸟是不能关在笼子里的
I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.



它们的羽毛太光亮
Their feathers are just too bright.



当它们飞走的时候
And when they fly away...



你会觉得把它们关起来是种罪恶
... the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.



但是
But still...



它们的离开让你生活的地方空荡荡的
... the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.



可能我只是想念我的朋友了
I guess I just miss my friend.



请坐
Please sit down.



瑞德
Ellis Boyd Redding...



你因终身监禁已被关了40年了
...your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.



你觉得你已改过了吗？
You feel you've been rehabilitated?



改过？
Rehabilitated?



让我想想
Well, now, let me see.



我不明白那是什么意思
I don't have any idea what that means.



你有心理准备重新投入社会吗？
It means you're ready to rejoin society...



我知道你们是怎么想的，老弟
I know what you think it means, sonny.



对我来说那只是个用来掩饰的词
To me it's just a made-up word.



政客用的词语
